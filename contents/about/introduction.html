        <section class="mb-8 text-justify">
            <p class="mb-4 text-justify">Tripura is located in the mountainous area in the north east of India bordering
                Bangladesh on three
                sides. The State has 3.67 million people (2011) and high population increase (1.5% per year from 2001
                to 2011). Industrial growth in the state is not so high compared with some of the other Indian states
                due to limited transportation facilities and lack of better road, rail and air connectivity with other
                parts
                of India. However, abundant forest resources (which cover 60% land of the state), plentiful rainfall and
                fertile soil are suitable for afforestation; thus, forestry is a major source of income of the state
                along
                with agriculture. The proportion of the workforce in agriculture and forest sector as well as residents'
                dependence on forests is high. </p>
            <p class="mb-4 text-justify">Under such circumstances, the State government has been making efforts in promoting joint
                forest
                management, transforming shifting cultivation to agroforestry and providing alternative livelihood
                activities. Within the said initiative, “Tripura Forest Environmental Improvement and Poverty
                Alleviation Project (TFIPAP)” has been implemented since 2007 with the focus on poverty alleviation.
                TFIPAP supported 463 Joint Forest Management Committees (JFMCs) and achieved more than 52,000
                ha of plantation. Dense forest has increased by 1107 km2 during the period between 2011 and 2017.
                However, the State’s Forest cover has declined greatly (251 km2 decrease between 2011 and 2017).
                This change has much influence on the natural environment and the living conditions of local
                population. In Tripura, forest cover loss and forest degradation have been mainly caused by shifting
                cultivation, which increases soil erosion risks on hill slopes especially in upper catchment areas. In
                the
                area wherein the most severe soil erosion confirmed, 80 ton of soil per year has been runoff.
                Furthermore, soil erosion not only reduces the capacity of irrigation facilities due to sedimentation
                but
                also decreases the access to drinking water in rural communities. To decrease these negative impacts
                on their living environment, appropriate interventions, such as the improvement of degraded forests
                through artificial regeneration (AR) and assisted natural regeneration (ANR) and mitigation of soil
                erosion risks by the construction of check dams, need to be implemented in a timely manner.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4 text-justify">In addition to these direct interventions for the increasing forest degradation and soil
                erosion, it is also
                important to address a major cause of the expansion of shifting cultivation. In Tripura, local people in
                rural communities still live under unfavorable socioeconomic conditions today. For example, land
                resources available for their income and job opportunities in rural communities are quite limited. This
                situation makes it difficult for local people to conduct settled agriculture especially in hilly area
                with
                steep slopes wherein agricultural water accessibility is challenging, and local people still need to
                depend on shifting cultivation. Under these circumstances, alternative livelihood opportunities for
                local people need to be introduced in order to slow the expansion of shifting cultivation and the
                increasing forest degradation and soil erosion.

            joint forest management in the State.

            Forest Management in Tripura (in short, SCATFORM, and hereinafter referred as the Project) is being
            started with the assistance from JICA. The main objective of the Project is to improve quality of forest

            livelihood development, thereby contributing to development of forest ecosystem services and
            livelihood improvement of forest dependent communities in the State of Tripura.
