                The Sexual Harassment Committee, formally known as the Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) under the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, plays a crucial role in promoting a safe, dignified, and inclusive work environment. Since the Tripura JICA SCATFORM Project involves interactions among government staff, NGO workers, SHGs, and community members, the committee ensures that women are protected from sexual harassment during project implementation.
