                The SCAT-AMS is a robust in-house application designed to effectively monitor project staff and their activities in real time. By capturing the actual Geo-fenced location and timestamp of staff members, the system ensures complete accuracy in attendance calculation for payroll processing. This has eliminated the need for manual record-keeping and significantly streamlined the attendance management process.
