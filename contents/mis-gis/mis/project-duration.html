                The implementation period of the Project is 10 years from September 2018 to September 2028 in
                consideration of capabilities of stakeholders and time required to conduct activities in sustainable
                manners. The project activities shall be implemented in selected forest Beats.

            </h2>
            <p class=" text-justify text-lg mb-4">
                Preparation Phase is crucial for successful implementation of the Project. The first step would be
                institutional arrangement by way of amendment of bylaws and name of the Society of the Project in
                accordance with the requirement of the new project, setting up Project Management Unit (PMU), District
                Management Unit (DMU), Sub-Divisional Management Unit (SDMU) and Range Management Unit (RMU) followed by
                deployment of contractual staff at PMU/DMU/SDMU/RMU. Reviewing and revising Operation Manual and other
                guidelines, orientation and capacity development for TFD staff in each rank, contractual staff, field
                staff and other stakeholders, preparation of GIS map, creation of BFBP as well as identification of
                JFMCs as well as Eco Development Committees (EDC), and formulation of Micro Plan would be conducted
                after identifying JFMCs. Required surveys and assessments for planning and baseline data shall be
                conducted during this phase.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold mb-2 mt-4">
                2. Implementation phase
            </h2>
            <p class=" text-justify text-lg mb-4">
                In Implementation Phase, activities envisaged for all components, namely Sustainable Forest Management,
                Soil and Moisture Conservation, Livelihood Development, and Institutional Strengthening shall be carried
                out. The activities are basically implemented by three batches in accordance with Micro Plan which shall
                be prepared in a participatory way. Target Self Help Group (SHG) or Joint Liability Group (JLG) shall
                also be selected and involved in livelihood improvement activities.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold mb-2 mt-4">
                3. Phase-Out
            </h2>
            <p class=" text-justify text-lg mb-4">
                In Phase-Out state, Phase-Out activities such as asset inventory, Phase-Out training for JFMCs/EDCs as
                well as SHGs/JLGs and revisiting of Micro Plan shall be undertaken, which is crucial for the project
                sustainability.
